# Chicago Crime and Well-Being Project
David Fried

Analyses included in class presentation involved the influence of health, birth, and economic factors on the Chicago neighborhood homicide rate. Analyses included correlation tables, regression analyses, 3d regression visualization, and predicted versus observed homicide bar chart. 

Conducted analsis on visualization of neighborhood crime but did not include in presentation.

*Did not include data on reported crime because it is over 7 mil cases (1.6 gigabytes).
*Also did not include output data.

*In order to run this code successfully you need to get the crime report data, put it in the data folder, and name it appropriately. You then need to structure your paths and folders as below and run the code in the following order:
    nbhd_data_exploration1.ipynb
    nbhd_data_exploration2.ipynb
    nbhd_final_analysis.ipynb


*Deleted config file in neighborhood_crime_map folder because it contained my api keys.

*The folder 'images_df' needs to be changed to 'output_data' for jupyter notebook code to run correctly. Also, make sure paths and folders are structured as follows:

    nbhd_data_exploration1.ipynb
    nbhd_data_exploration2.ipynb
    nbhd_final_analysis.ipynb
    data
    output_data
    neighborhood_crime_map

Any folder not included in the list above is not relevant for the code files to run. Before running code in the neighborhood_crime_map folder, be sure to create a 'config.py' folder with your api codes.
