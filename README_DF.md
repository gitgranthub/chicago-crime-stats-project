# Chicago Crime and Well-Being Project

Analyses included health, birth, and economic factors on the Chicago neighborhood homicide rate. Code creates correlation tables, regression analyses, 3d regression visualization, and predicted versus observed homicide bar chart. 

Conducted analsis on visualization of neighborhood crime but did not include in presentation.

Did not include input or output data.

In order to run this code successfully you need to get the appropriate data, name the data files appropriately, and put them in a folder titled "data." Below are the code file names.
    nbhd_data_exploration1.ipynb
    nbhd_data_exploration2.ipynb
    nbhd_final_analysis.ipynb
    nbhd_final_analysis_with_log_transformation.ipynb
    crime_mapping.ipynb (in neighborhood_crime_map folder)

Deleted config file in neighborhood_crime_map folder because it contained my api keys.

The folder 'images_df' needs to be changed to 'output_data' for jupyter notebook code to run correctly. Also, make sure paths and folders are structured as follows:

    nbhd_data_exploration1.ipynb
    nbhd_data_exploration2.ipynb
    nbhd_final_analysis.ipynb
    nbhd_final_analysis_with_log_transformation.ipynb
    data
    output_data
    neighborhood_crime_map

Any folder not included in the list above is not relevant for the code files to run. Before running code in the neighborhood_crime_map folder, be sure to create a 'config.py' folder with your api codes.
