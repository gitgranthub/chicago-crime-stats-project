Research Objective:
The influence of Health, birth, and economic factors on crime rates:
Between U.S. states
Between Chicago neighborhoods

Hypothesis:
U.S. states and Chicago neighborhoods that have populations  with poorer health, more teen pregnancies, and higher unemployment have greater crime.

Results:
Chicago neighborhoods with higher cancer rates, teen birth rates, and unemployment rates had greater neighborhood homicide rates. States with more poverty and unemployment had greater property crime and violence.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Health/social factors and economic factors and crime rate
Discuss health/social and economic factors at state level, such as …. Cancer, birthrates
Discuss health/social and economic factors at neighborhood level, such as …per capita member

Chicago has a high number of murders: the city often records the highest absolute total killings each year. But the data tells us that Chicago’s murder rate is nowhere near the nation’s worst. On a per-capita basis — murders per 100,000 residents — the city regularly experiences fewer killings than places whose murder rates get far less national attention, “Because Chicago has so many people, it can get a murder every day, and that gets people’s attention,” “When you focus on numbers, not rates, Chicago ends up looking worse because you forget just how big a city it is.”

Conclusion: Key Findings
CHICAGO CRIME & WELL-BEING TRENDS
Research Objective
U.S. states and Chicago neighborhoods that have populations  with poorer health, more teen pregnancies, and higher unemployment have greater crime.

Results:
Chicago neighborhoods with higher cancer rates, teen birth rates, and unemployment rates had greater neighborhood homicide rates. 
States with more poverty and unemployment had greater property crime and violence.

Other interesting findings: 
Contrary to popular belief, the murder rate in Chicago is lower than many other major cities when the murder rate is adjusted for population size.
There were no correlations between health factors and crime rates when analyzing differences between states.



Discussion: Research Conclusions
CHICAGO CRIME & WELL-BEING TRENDS
Results generally support our hypotheses.

However, there was no relationship between health and crime when analyzing differences between states...

Sex education: Discouraging teens from becoming pregnant may decrease stress, which could reduce tendency toward violent crime. (increase sex education)

Raising the minimum wage and increasing welfare services: may reduce stress associated with low income which might decrease the tendency toward violent crime.

Improving healthcare

 based on aggregated data (e.g., aggregated at neighborhood and state level)


Research design (cross-sectional ): Correlation does not prove causation. Cannot rule out confounds.

Levels of analysis: Factors that differ between neighborhoods and state influence the crime rate. Makes this difficult to draw conclusions about how these factors predict individual differences in the crime rate.

Measures:   Didn’t include factors such as obesity and smoking.  Limited measure of crime: Only measured murder, violent crime,  and property crime.

Lack of controls: Didn’t control for factors such as age.

Discussion: Future Research
CHICAGO CRIME & WELL-BEING TRENDS
Different measures of health and economic factors

Measures of psychological well-being (e.g., happiness and self esteem)

Different measures of crime (e.g., sexual crimes and different types of violent crimes)
